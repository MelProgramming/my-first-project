# My first project on GitHub
This is my first project on GitHub! I am hoping for many more in the future, but I have been working on another project before I became active on GitHub. The project is called twitter sentiment analysis and I am hoping to upload it soon to GitHub. 

For now, this project marks my very first GitHub project. It simply includes a stock image of a sad lion.
